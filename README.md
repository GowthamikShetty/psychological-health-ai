# Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect mental health conditions—**Anxiety**, **Depression**, and **Stress**—using machine learning models trained on survey-based datasets. It provides a foundation for early detection and awareness through data-driven analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessed datasets for Anxiety, Depression, and Stress.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
- Machine Learning models for prediction and classification.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Potential for real-time applications via integration with AI/IoT.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Future Scope

- Integrate real-time IoT data (e.g., from wearables).
- Expand to mobile/web platforms for accessibility.
- Enhance models with deep learning.
- Collaborate with mental health professionals for deployment.
- Extend work through academic research and publications.

## 🧠 Datasets

The datasets are anonymized responses to mental health questionnaires, categorized into Anxiety, Depression, and Stress. They include various features such as age, gender, academic pressure, sleep patterns, and social interaction.
